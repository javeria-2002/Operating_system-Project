						<h2>CPU Scheduling Algorithms</h2>

					<p>CPU Scheduling is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another
						process is on hold. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU
						remains idle, the OS at least select one of the processes available in the ready queue for
						execution. The selection process will be carried out by the CPU scheduler. It selects one of the
						processes in memory that are ready for execution.</p>

						<h3>Scheduling Algorithms</h3>
						<p>In computing, scheduling is the method by which work is assigned to resources that complete
							the work. The work may be virtual computation elements such as threads, processes or data
							flows, which are in turn scheduled onto hardware resources such as processors, network links
							or expansion cards.

							A scheduler is what carries out the scheduling activity. Schedulers are often implemented so
							they keep all computer resources busy (as in load balancing), allow multiple users to share
							system resources effectively, or to achieve a target quality of service. Scheduling is
							fundamental to computation itself, and an intrinsic part of the execution model of a
							computer system; the concept of scheduling makes it possible to have computer multitasking
							with a single central processing unit (CPU). Given below are the description about 8
							implemented algorithms</p>

								<div class="box">
									<h4>Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)</h4>
									<p>This Algorithm is the preemptive version of SJF scheduling. In SRTF, the
										execution of the process can be stopped after certain amount of time.
										At the arrival of every process, the short term scheduler schedules the process
										with the least remaining burst time among the list of available processes and
										the running process.</p>
								</div>
							</article>

								<div class="box">
									<h4>Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)</h4>
									<p>Prerequisite – CPU Scheduling
										Given n processes with their Arrival times and Burst times, the task is to find
										average waiting time and average turn around time using HRRN scheduling
										algorithm.
										The name itself states that we need to find the response ratio of all available
										processes and select the one with the highest Response Ratio.
										A process once selected will run till completion.</p>
								</div>
							</article>
							<article>
								<div class="box">
									<h4>Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)</h4>
									<p>Prerequisite – Process Management & CPU Scheduling
										This is a pre-emptive version of Longest Job First (LJF) scheduling algorithm.
										In this scheduling algorithm, we find the process with the maximum remaining
										time and then process it.
										We check for the maximum remaining time after some interval of time(say 1 unit
										each) to check if another process having more Burst Time arrived up to that
										time.</p>
